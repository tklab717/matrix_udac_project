# Implement Î± Matrix Class
### About scripts
Initial scripts are provided from Udacity.  
I modified matrix.py to create matrix class.  

+ matrix.py
+ matrix_playground.ipynb
+ matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb 
+ kalman_filter_demo.ipynb

### Pupose

  I learn implementing matrix class through this project.

##### Created functions in matrix class

+ determinant(self)
+ trace(self)
+ inverse(self)
+ transpose(self)
+ \__add__(self, other)
+ \__sub__(self, other)
+ \__mul__(self, other)
